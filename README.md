Environment Setup:
The development process commenced with the establishment of a virtual environment for Python, utilizing the -venv command to proficiently manage dependencies.
Frontend Development (Eel):
Eel, a module designed for frontend development, was employed to forge a connection between Python and HTML. This facilitated a seamless integration between the backend and the HTML-based user interface.
Backend Development:
Backend functionalities were integrated employing pertinent libraries such as pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion and Speech_recognition for speech recognition. This enabled interaction with users through both textual and auditory inputs.
Customization and Integration:
The frontend underwent customization to interact harmoniously with backend operations, ensuring that user actions triggered the requisite backend processes effectively.
Data Management (sqlite3):
The sqlite3 library was harnessed for database operations, encompassing the storage of application data, management of chat history, and retrieval of information with efficiency.
User Interaction (Pvporcupine):
User interaction features, notably hot word detection, were instantiated utilizing the Pvporcupine library. This facilitated the activation of the assistant upon detection of specific trigger words or phrases.
Audio Handling (playsound, pyaudio):
Functionality pertaining to the playback of sound files and management of audio input/output was integrated using libraries such as playsound and pyaudio. This served to augment user experience and interaction.
GUI Automation (pyautogui):
GUI automation was realized through the implementation of the pyautogui library, facilitating the manipulation of mouse and keyboard inputs. This streamlined automated interactions with the graphical user interface.
